**Files not opening? Before you open a new issue:**

Try cloning the entire repository or downloading the zipped archive. Several people have reported that downloading the raw files individually yields corrupted models. Thanks!

##Update 7/22/2016

I apologize for the delay in updating the 3D Models, I'm starting from scratch using a proper CAD software in order to have surface-based models for my manufacturers. This will allow me to post a wider variety of formats for those of you who are building your own as well. Stay tuned! 

##Update 7/20/2016

I have tallied up the phone models requested at the pokedex email address and the results are in! I have dummy phones coming to me for the following models: **iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, Samsung Galaxy S7, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, HTC One M8**

This doesn't mean that I won't make models (or accept pull requests for models) that fit other phones, but the production run of resin cast cases will likely be made to fit these phones. Because the cases are not designed to allow access to the side buttons, they will probably be widely compatible (I imagine the S7 model will fit the S4/5/6/7, for example) But keep an eye here for updates. 

Also, I am not taking pre-orders or building a waiting list until the unit price is announced but please let me know if you're interested and what phone you have!

I will be building a mailing list from the emails that I have already recieved at the address below and will send periodic updates both for people making their own and people interested in buying a pre-built unit. 

Thanks again for all the support, you folks are great!

##Update 7/18/2016

I am humbled by the reaction to my project, it's been a lot of fun to work on. There's more to come...

Good news! I'm currently working on machining the molds to resin cast pokedex cases! They will be stronger and cheaper than 3D printed cases and hopefully I'll be able to produce them in a variety of colors for a variety of models and team insignia! Keep an eye here for updates. 

##Update 7/14/2016

Hey all, I've had requests for iPhone6S compatible cases. I'm testing a model right now! I've also had requests for more filetypes that might be compatible with more modeling software, I'll get as many up as I can. 

Be warned! I've just discovered that some of these files are mirrored and I haven't had a chance to fix them. 

Some people have asked if they can buy one from me, I'm currently exploring the options and testing models for several popular phones but they take some time to print so it will be a few days before I'm happy with them. In the event that I work out a way to sell finished Pokédex cases, I'll put the link here. 

Thanks for your patience, new models are coming tomorrow!
